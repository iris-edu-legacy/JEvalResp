JEvalResp

JEvalResp is a Java version of the 'evalresp' program and, like the original, it is designed to evaluate the response information from ASCII "RESP" files generated by rdseed (V4.1 and above).  JEvalResp is also capable of fetching and processing responses from FISSURES servers.

----------------------------

"JEvalResp.jar":  Stand-alone application jar.

"JEvalRespClasses.jar":  JEvalResp and 'isti.util' classes without library classes.

----------------------------

The JBuilder project file "JEvalRespf.jpx" configures the project without FISSURES server support.
